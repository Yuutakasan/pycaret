5. ✅ **Mobile Support:** Optimized payloads, offline capability
6. ✅ **Disaster Recovery:** Cache persistence, graceful degradation

### Critical Gaps (Must Fix)

1. ❌ **No Authentication:** Implement JWT (3-5 days)
2. ❌ **No Authorization:** Implement RBAC (2-3 days)
3. ❌ **No HTTPS Enforcement:** Configure SSL (1 day)
4. ⚠️ **Manual Backups Only:** Automate backups (2-3 days)
5. ⚠️ **No Health Checks:** Add `/health` endpoint (1 day)

### Next Steps

1. **Week 1:** Implement authentication, authorization, HTTPS
